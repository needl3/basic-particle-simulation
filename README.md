# Particle Simulation
A small project to simulate basic variables that affect particle-particle interaction. It's no way a scientifically accurate simulation. I'm not that smart enough [Sad face].

## Variables added
- Elastic Collision
- Universal gravity [ Yes I made it up tbh. I just need a gravity source to affect all particles rn ]
- Boundary collision

## Variables to add
- [ ] Particle-Particle gravity simulation

## Known bugs
- [ ] Boundary collision checker is doing weird stuffs
- [ ] Collision sometimes is inelastic, dunno if it's really what happens or I'm stupid(Pretty sure I am)

##### I need to optimize this at last really badly.
